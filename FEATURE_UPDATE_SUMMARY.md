# Feature Update Summary

## üéØ Changes Made

This update implements two major features requested by the user:

### 1. ‚úÖ Manual Item Selection After OCR Extraction

**Problem:** Previously, when a receipt was scanned, all extracted items were automatically added to the inventory without user review.

**Solution:** Items are now extracted and presented to the user with checkboxes for manual selection.

#### Changes Made:
- **File:** `app/page.tsx`
- **New State Variables:**
  - `extractedItemsForSelection` - Stores prepared items from OCR
  - `selectedItemIndices` - Tracks which items user has selected

- **New Functions:**
  - `addSelectedReceiptItems()` - Adds only the selected items to inventory
  - `toggleItemSelection(idx)` - Toggles selection of individual items
  - `toggleAllItems()` - Selects/deselects all items at once

- **Modified Function:**
  - `handleReceiptUpload()` - Now prepares items for selection instead of auto-adding

- **New UI Section:**
  - Interactive checkbox list showing all extracted items
  - Visual feedback for selected items (green border + checkmark)
  - Shows item details: name, quantity, unit, category, expiry date
  - "Select All" / "Deselect All" button
  - "Add X Items to Inventory" button (only enabled if items selected)
  - "Cancel" button to dismiss without adding

#### User Workflow Now:
1. User uploads receipt image
2. OCR extracts items
3. **NEW:** User sees all extracted items with checkboxes (all selected by default)
4. **NEW:** User can review, deselect unwanted items, or select/deselect all
5. **NEW:** User clicks "Add X Items to Inventory" button
6. Only selected items are added to inventory
7. Success message shows how many items were added

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Unified Backend Service Launcher

**Problem:** Previously, users had to manually start 4 separate Python backend services in 4 different terminals.

**Solution:** Created unified launcher scripts that start all services with a single command.

#### New Files Created:

**`ocr-service/start_all_services.py`** (Backend Only)
- Starts all 4 Python backend services simultaneously
- Uses multiprocessing to run services in parallel
- Graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C
- Services:
  - OCR Service (port 8000)
  - Food Classification (port 8001)
  - AI Shopping List (port 8002)
  - AI Meal Generator (port 8003)

**`ocr-service/start_fullstack.py`** (Full Stack)
- Starts all 4 Python backend services
- PLUS starts Next.js frontend (port 3000)
- One command to run the entire application
- Auto-detects pnpm or npm for frontend

**`ocr-service/LAUNCHER_README.md`**
- Complete documentation for the new launchers
- Usage instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- Comparison table: old vs new method

#### Usage:

**Backend Only:**
```bash
cd ocr-service
python start_all_services.py
```

**Full Stack:**
```bash
cd ocr-service
python start_fullstack.py
```

**Stop All Services:**
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

## üìä Testing Recommendations

### Test Manual Item Selection:
1. Start the backend services: `cd ocr-service && python start_all_services.py`
2. Start the frontend: `npm run dev` (or use full stack launcher)
3. Navigate to the Tracking page
4. Click "Scan Receipt" button
5. Upload a sample receipt image from `sample_images/` folder
6. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Items appear with checkboxes (all selected by default)
   - ‚úÖ Can click individual items to toggle selection
   - ‚úÖ "Select All" / "Deselect All" button works

   - ‚úÖ Only selected items are added when button is clicked
   - ‚úÖ Success toast shows correct count
   - ‚úÖ Dialog closes after adding
   - ‚úÖ Items appear in inventory table

### Test Unified Backend Launcher:

2. Run: `cd ocr-service && python start_all_services.py`
3. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ All 4 services start successfully
   - ‚úÖ Services appear on correct ports (8000-8003)
   - ‚úÖ Logs from all services appear in terminal
   - ‚úÖ Ctrl+C gracefully stops all services
4. Test each service:
   - http://localhost:8000/docs (OCR Service - Swagger docs)
   - http://localhost:8001/docs (Food Classification)
   - http://localhost:8002/docs (AI Shopping)
   - http://localhost:8003/docs (AI Meal)

### Test Full Stack Launcher:
1. Close all services
2. Run: `cd ocr-service && python start_fullstack.py`
3. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ All backend services start
   - ‚úÖ Frontend starts automatically
   - ‚úÖ Can open http://localhost:3000
   - ‚úÖ Full application works end-to-end
   - ‚úÖ Ctrl+C stops both frontend and backend
